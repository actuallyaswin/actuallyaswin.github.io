# aswin.db/music

A visual diary for Aswin's music listening history (logged from 2011 onward). It is an interactive, client-side web app for exploring 14+ years of music listening data with detailed statistics. Backed by a SQLite database, everything runs entirely in-browser without a backend. The webapp combines data from multiple sources: <b><i>Last.fm</i></b> for listening history (scrobbles with timestamps), <b><i>Spotify</i></b> for artist photos + album art, and <b><i>MusicBrainz</i></b> for album metadata.

## Other Ideas / TODOs

- Come up with an innovative way for me to embed DJ mixes here in a neat way
- Import concert and festival attendance data from [setlist.fm](https://www.setlist.fm)
- Import my CD and vinyl collection data from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com)
- Add music videos or provide references to external streaming sources
